Rozana is a Saudi Arabian FMCG company that produces food, beverages, and personal care products. They approached us with the need for a website to showcase their products and services in order to expand their reach in the Middle East. It was our job to develop the website according to Rozana's specifications.



The Rozana team was looking for an agency that could provide them with everything they needed related to web development and design. They wanted someone who could help them create the perfect website, one that would not only work well but also look good on any screen size. They were looking for a professional team to build a website that would be able to serve their business and provide them with an online identity. The company wanted to create an online presence to help them reach out to their customers and potential customers. They wanted the website to be interactive and engaging so they could engage with their target audience on social media channels as well as on their website.





We developed a website for Rozana, a Saudi Arabian FMCG company. The website showcases Rozana's products and services in order to expand their reach in the Middle East. In order to achieve this goal, we developed a responsive website for Rozana from scratch using the CMS backend. The site is responsive so it can be viewed on any device and it also includes an e-commerce section where customers can purchase Rozana's products online. The website also includes the ability for customers to sign up for Rozana's e-mail newsletter and social media feeds.
