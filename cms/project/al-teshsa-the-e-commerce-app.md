Al-Teshsa is a company that sells exotic dried fruits and nuts. Al-Teshsa is a company that sells exotic dried fruits and nuts. They have been in the business for over 30 years and they are one of the leading suppliers of dried fruits and nuts in the Middle East. They were looking for an app to help them sell their products online. They wanted the app to be easy to use and have a clean interface design.



Al-Teshsa's goal was to create a mobile app with a clean interface that would be easy to use, but powerful. In order to do this, they wanted to create an app where users could buy products and download recipes from their site. They also wanted the app to be available in Arabic to show their dedication and involvement in the global community. We developed an app for Al-Teshsa, which was designed with the user in mind. The interface is simple and easy to navigate, which makes it perfect for people who don't know much about technology or how to use apps.



We designed an interface that lets the users know where they are and what they should do next step-by-step. An essential feature of Al-Teshsa is its location awareness, which shows the user's current location on a map in real-time. This app was created to help Al-Teshsa provide more personal service and build a positive relationship with their customers.
